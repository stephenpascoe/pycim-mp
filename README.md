What is jscim ?
--------------------------------------

jscim is a highly modularised javascript library built ontop of underscore, backbone & jquery.  It is designed to render & display metadata compliant with the Metafor CIM standards. 


What is the Metafor CIM ?
--------------------------------------

Metafor was a European project tasked with defining a metadata standard for describing scientific processes, particularly climate modelling processes.  This metadata standard came to be known as the CIM (Common Information Model).

Why jscim ?
--------------------------------------

CIM metadata is typically encoded in an xml format that is complex in structure and large  in size.  jscim resolves these issues and allows 3rd parties to effortlessly integrate CIM metadata into their websites.

jscim is used by several websites including:
	1. Earth System Grid - Federation peer-to-peer web front end;
	2. IPSL Prodiguer Portal.
	3. KNMI Impacts portal.
